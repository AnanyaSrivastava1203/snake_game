# snake_game
This project is a classic Snake Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 20x20 grid-based board, where players control the snake using the arrow keys. The objective is to collect food (🍎) to grow the snake and increase the score while avoiding collisions with the snake’s own body. The game dynamically updates the snake’s position, food placement, and score display. The UI is designed with a modern, gradient background and smooth animations, making gameplay visually appealing. The project is beginner-friendly and serves as a great introduction to JavaScript-based game development.
